# Matrix Multiplication on Spark

In Scala main program, args(0) is the first input matrix M, args(1) is the second input matrix N, and args(2) is the output directory. 

There are two small sparce matrices 4\*3 and 3\*3 in the files M-matrix-small.txt and N-matrix-small.txt for testing in small matrices. Their matrix multiplication must return the 4\*3 matrix in solution-small.txt.

Then there are 2 moderate-sized matrices 200\*100 and 100\*300 in the files M-matrix-large.txt and M-matrix-large.txt for testing in large matrices inputs. Their matrix multiplication must return the matrix in solution-large.txt.

1. Build commands are mentioned in "multiply.build" file.
2. Run commands are mentioned in "multiply.run" file.
